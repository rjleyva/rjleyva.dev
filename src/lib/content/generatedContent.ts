At first glance, it looked like\na hydration issue, a delayed theme state update, or even an SVG rendering problem.\nBut after digging deeper, it turned out to be something much simpler.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nSurprisingly, the issue wasn’t React, the theme toggle, or Vite. I spent way too\nlong checking React DevTools before I thought to look at the CSS. The culprit was\na single line of CSS:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nBecause the icons used `filter` for coloring, specifying `transition: all` caused\nthe browser to animate every possible property. During the theme change, some of\nthese properties temporarily passed through invalid or intermediate visual states,\nwhich is exactly what caused the flicker.\n\n## The FIX\n\nThe solution was simple once I understood the problem. Instead of transitioning\nevery property, I limited the transition to exactly what I needed. Updating the\nCSS for the social icons to:\n\n```css\n.socials__icon {\n  /* Transition only filter to prevent unwanted flickers */\n  transition: filter var(--transition-duration-normal);\n  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0 transparent);\n}\n```\n\nOnce I changed:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nto:\n\n```css\ntransition: filter;\n```\n\nThe flicker disappeared entirely.\n\nNo JavaScript changes.\nNo theme logic changes.\nJust a scoped transition.\n\n# A Lesson in transition: all\n\n> `transition: all` is convenient — but often dangerous.\n\nThis experience reinforced an easy-to-forget rule. Animating all properties can\ncause unintended visual glitches during state changes, trigger strange\nintermediate render states, and make bugs harder to reason about. Explicitly\ntargeting only the properties that need animation is safer, more predictable, and\nprevents subtle UI regressions.\n\nThis small bug reminded me that some of the most valuable lessons come from tiny,\nalmost invisible issues. It wasn’t about performance, complex architecture, or\nadvanced animations. It was about paying attention to the details. I'd been\ncareless with `transition: all` because it was quick and seemed harmless, but\nthat one line caused a subtle visual glitch that took way too long to track down.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nBe intentional with transitions. Target only the properties you need to animate\nand avoid `transition: all` unless you really mean it. This prevents subtle\nvisual glitches and makes your UI more predictable.\n",

Let's skip the `brew install` tutorial and jump straight into my questionable choices.\n\n## The Settings\n\n- Keeps the interface distraction-free. I only focus on the current task.\n\n```lua\nenable_tab_bar = false\n```\n\n- Gives you just enough window frame to resize, but not enough to feel like your terminal is trying to compete with Photoshop. Minimalist vibes only.\n\n```lua\nwindow_decorations = \"RESIZE\"\n```\n\n- Adds a subtle macOS blur to your background. Makes your terminal feel dreamy and cinematic… like you're the lead in a hacker indie film nobody asked for.\n\n```lua\nmacos_window_background_blur = 10\n```\n\n- Skip the transparency. My GPU doesn't need extra cardio just so my terminal can cosplay as glass.\n\n```lua\nwindow_background_opacity = 1.0,\n```\n\n- Font and size that actually respect your eyes—big enough for long sessions.\n\n```lua\nfont = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" })\nfont_size = 18\n```\n\n- Scrollback lines set to 10,000 because logs have commitment issues. Sometimes they stretch forever and you just want to find that one typo without a time machine.\n\n```lua\nscrollback_lines = 10000\n```\n\n- Colors designed for long ChatGPT sessions, I mean coding sessions.\n\n```lua\ncolors = {\n  foreground = \"#839395\",\n  background = \"#001419\",\n\n  cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n  selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n  selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n  ansi = {\n    \"#001014\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#9eabac\",\n  },\n\n  brights = {\n    \"#001419\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#839395\",\n  },\n},\n```\n\n# Copy and Paste\n\nHere's the full setup in case you just want to copy and go.\n\n```lua\nlocal wezterm = require(\"wezterm\")\n\nlocal M = {}\n\nM.spec = {\n  enable_tab_bar = false,\n  window_decorations = \"RESIZE\",\n  window_background_opacity = 1.0,\n  macos_window_background_blur = 10,\n  font = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" }),\n  font_size = 18,\n  scrollback_lines = 10000,\n\n  colors = {\n    foreground = \"#839395\",\n    background = \"#001419\",\n\n    cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n    selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n    selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n    ansi = {\n      \"#001014\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#9eabac\",\n    },\n\n    brights = {\n      \"#001419\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#839395\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nreturn M.spec\n```\n\n---\n\n_Crafted with questionable coffee decisions and a healthy disregard for transparency._\n\n_Generated with help from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)_\n",
